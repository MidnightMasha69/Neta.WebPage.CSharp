            <p id="w-text">Well, What can i say...<br />
             My Name is Israel SHevkolenko and Im a 14 Years<br/> 
             old teen and 15 by second july, and coding wasnt always my thing to be honest...<br />
            You can call me creator or an editor but in my life i engaged a lot in everything,<br />
            photos, videos, 3d objects and animation, music and starting from mid 2017<br/>
             - coding/programming. Both Editing and creating. My interest in computers started from age 6<br />
             and electronics a bit later. i was disassembling and assembling many many electronics -<br/ >
             PC's, monitors, printers, phones, and many other. always when something broke<br />
             i fixed it myself instead of paying someone a lot of precious money. only one time <br/ >
            i took my pc for repairs by someone because one of the chips burned. also my phone<br />
             i changed the screen two times because im a bit clumsy and forgot to put an actual case with <br />
            armor instead of a nice case i loved. Even at school i showed my talent at school <br />
            when it's school projects and niche presentations or funny and professionally made videos, <br />
            or helping teachers with the projectors failing or other configurations like internet and display. <br />
            i cant even remember how many times i was called to fix the computer in another class but it was a lot.<br />
            basically im a lot of time in my computer and i do everything i also game and a lot, sometimes research<br />
            something, but overall im not some nerd or something, you wouldnt wanna go to a roast contest with me,
            trust me, you shouldn't. im a good preson but if you betray me or do something very bad to me i can be so
            cruel you wouldnt even think its me. somehow i had 3 girlfriends in middle school which i just finished 2 days ago
            By the time i wrote this. for the end ill quote one sentence from one of my favorite artist of my music i listen,
            i listen to bass house and riddim. - 6/22/2018</p><p id="quote"><i><b>"Look, if life pushes you down<br /> you gotta push back<br />
